# LeckSMS

LeckSMS is a terminal based application that allows you to test the vulnerability of the SMS systems on your own websites.
It won't cause any harm, it just acts like an "SMS Bomber" which is generally used for social-engineering attacks.


<h2>Setup</h2>

```console
git clone https://gitlab.com/ardaerturkk/lecksms.git
cd Enough
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 enough.py
```
<h2>Important Notice</h2>

This program should only be used for test purposes, for your own website(s).
LeckSMS can not harm or damage any systems or people on it's own.
It is strictly forbidden to use LeckSMS for any harmful activities.
@ardaerturkk won't be responsible for any misuse.

LeckSMS is a heavily modified version of an old SMS Bomber, found online. All harmful features have been cleaned. And the code is modified to create a harmless SMS system testing tool.
